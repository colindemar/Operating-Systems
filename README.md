# Operating-Systems
I use Microsoft Windows as my operating system. One of its advantages is how convenient it is. One disadvantage is its excessive costs.
One advantage of the macOS is it gives your computer fewer virus attacks. One disadvantage is that you are unable to play games on it. If you want to play any kind of games, you must not get the macOS system.
My current operating system on my computer is Microsoft Edge. One of its advantages is its speed and reliability. However, one of its disadvantages is incomplete data.
